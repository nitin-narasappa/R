# Examples of Vector
# names, ids, subjects and marks are vectors of different type.

names <- c("John", "Tom", "Bob")

ids <- 5:7

subjects <- c("English", "Maths", "Science")

marks <- c(80, 75, 85)

# Following will print "John" <- first element of vector names.
print(names[1])

# Mean of the marks vector
mean(marks)

# Square root of every element of marks
sqrt(marks)

# multiply every element by 2 and assign it to new vector
## NOTE:  The other way of assignment.
marks * 2 -> newMarks

# NOTE how the vectors are printed
> newMarks
